# Melno
Just a countdown timer/stopwatch. With weird interface.

### Building
You'll need to build/install [QtUiUtils](https://github.com/namark/QtUiUtils) first.<br />
Build with Qt5. The application will try to play the file named "melno.wav" in its running directory as an alarm sound. You can find a sample file in [releases](https://github.com/namark/Melno/releases). There's also a standalone windows build right next to it.

### Usage
The "Up" button will reset the timer and start counting up. The "Down" button will will start counting down from the current state of the timer and alert the user when countdown finishes. The rest should be quite easy to figure out.
